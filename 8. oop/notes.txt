- to return two values you can seperate it using a comma between two variables. This is called a tuple. 
- to store the return value you can list the to varibles next to the function eg. name, house = fun()
* you don't need to use the same vaibles fro each function

- Tuple: is a anoter type of date in python that;s a collection of values (eg. x,y,z) and is similar to a list
    - it also cannot be modified (immutable)
        - if you override it by trying to change it, a TypeError will occur
        - to override it and change the contents use []
            - list can change, tuple cannot change
            -  lists are defined by []
            - tuples are defined by ()
            - when you access it you use [no.]
            - dictionaries are mutable
    - tuples can have vairbles inside of them
    - it's similar to a list because in a list you have two things while in one tuple you ave two things
    - eg. return (name,house) or return name,house
        - the parenthesis are used to show that there is one clause with two things
    - tuple's are used to not allow anyone to change the varibles
    - 

- Immutable: you can't change it, in regards to oop
