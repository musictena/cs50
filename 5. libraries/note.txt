Libraries are code that others have written to assist others.
Modules in python are a library that has one or more function built into into
libraries are used to reduece reusability

python comes with a 'random.py' library (modules), has functions to make things be random.
docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

keyword 'import' allows you to import some modules in python
random.choice(seq), exists within the 'random' module

from is a kqyword that will only call the cfunction from a module
random.randint(a,b); random number between the two numbers
random.shuffle(x); takes a list of things and it shuffles them


library: statics; calculate means, modes

command-line arguements = allows u to provide is when u exectue it at the command line (eg. python hello.py)

sys= system contains the functionality for the system 
sys.asrv = arguement vector, which is a list of all the commands that the user provides before the press enter, the first element is going to be the first word you type etc.

indexError: assuming something is at location one but it isn't there

slices: to take a slice of a list, to take a subset of a data structure
eg. (for arg in sys.argv[1:]) <- start from one ; if you use a negative 1 (-1) then it minuses one from the list

packages: a module implemented in a folder. it is a third party library to gain more functionality
    you can get this from pypi.org

cowsay: a package to allow a cow to say something
to get a package into a system is to use a package manager which is a prgram that allows u to download packages via 'pip'
another is trex
--> essentially it displays a specified animal that says a specific string


the point of using command line arguements is to is because it's faster because it's easy to configure your software

api = application programming interfaces: usually refer to third praty services that live on th internet


another package is using api: request library allows you to make web requests, it can be used to automate
json is a programming language that is standard in a standard way based on search terms


sys.argv is used to break the whole programming while break is to break from a function


we can also make your own libraries 

__name__ is used to when you run a command from the commandline
